Hey everyone! hope you all are good. This is abi, keeping it short cuz this is my first ever blog and to be honest i don’t even know what’s the actual format to write a blog. And no wonder that, this is how all our journey is starting right? It’s really the excitment, the obsession, the interest to learn something new that drives you crazy. I have to tell you the excitement that i have right now (24th - aug - 2025 \[23:32\]) is just feels like solving 10 hard question in the leetcode on my own. Cuz i have the interest to explore new things i hope that i’m doing it in a right way, i dream to achieve new things on my life i hope i will continue do that. I wanted to be a passionate learner - to learn about everything that i find fascinating.

My learning journey actually begins after my 10th boards where i took a Bio-group in my 11th. I find everything each and every sciences (by the way don’t look for proper spellings or word check it too comes under the part of our learning lol ) that i read over was completely blown out my mind. Becuase that’s the time i start out my jouney as a real learner and not who just memorize & vomit in the examination. I have to tell you about the teachers, god damn seriously they are the **best,fisrt and last** teachers who tought me each and every nuances of the science (either it’s zoology or botony) in a best possible way(on my pov).

But the irony is i took engineering in the domain of ai and data science after my 12th, lmao. okay now serious - I have to tell the brutal truth too, cause learning alone is doesn’t gonna help. I’ve missed out a lot of oppurtunities just becuase i made myself into the belief of learning gives you more and more extra knowledge than actually trying out the practical part.

I would like to clear this with an example - Let’s say there’s two people who’s names goes Ramsami and Goindasami. Both students are very bright, no one is less than the other. Ramsami is a great student where he score good in everything in the internals,in the semester exams and meanwhile he is learning a lot of new technologies like machine learning, neural networks and much more. Later, days passed now ramasami is in 2nd year, he is still learning more into machine learning like deep learning, and the advanced version of the deep learning like into opencv and more. Then again when he is in 3rd he is still learning some other tech stack because he wanted to use the ml algorithms in the produciton. And now he is in the final year, with no internships and he is still learning the same thing again and again. On the other hand Goindasami, he is as same as ramsami but goindasami had enough amount of learnings and started applying for internships, thers’s no stipend but that’s fine for him - he gained a lot experience. Then he learned the advanced concepts and applied for another internship this time he got one with low stipend but this is fine for him, all he focused on is learning with experience. Then later on he applied for jobs role, goindasami got one. And that’s how he build his career.Ramasami thought that all the learnings that he had wasn’t enough for him where he wants to learn more and more because of the fear of rejection, you can avoid it for a certain period of time but not totally. Where ramsami focused on only learnings, goindasami focused on learning with experience.

Therefore, here I’m insisting you becuase i too have the **experience of ramasami** so don’t just learn but learn by doing the practical hands-on. Go and get your hands dirty and explore the world like you own it. Lastly i’ve learned from the mistake and i’ve corrected it properly. My framework for the learning is LEARN - DO - RELEARN - REDO dot.
